# 👋 Hi, I'm Francois – Engineer turned Educator

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I’m transitioning from a career as a **Consulting Engineer** to a new chapter as an **Educator**, where I plan to teach **Mathematics and Science**.

I’m passionate about using my technical background and love for coding to create engaging, student-focused tools and resources.

## 🎯 My Mission
To empower students through **interactive learning tools** that make complex concepts clear, engaging, and accessible. I aim to combine real-world engineering experience with educational best practices.

## 🔧 What I'm Building
- 📊 **EduCharts** – Interactive Python visualizations for explaining math and physics
- 🧪 **PracticeHub** – A Django-based dashboard for student self-assessment and exam prep
- 🧱 **3D Physics Lab** – Blender models uploaded to Sketchfab for classroom use

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: `Python`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` (learning)
- **Libraries**: `Pandas`, `Bokeh`
- **Frameworks**: `Django`, `Jupyter`
- **3D & Visualization**: `Blender`, `Sketchfab`
- **Other**: `Markdown`, `Git`, `GitHub`

## 📚 Goals for 2025
- Launch my first **free** open-source classroom toolkit  
- Start publishing **3D STEM models** to Sketchfab  
- Begin building a library of **paid resources** for educators
